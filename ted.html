<P>You have the right paper before you if you are not up for a read that sing praises of

    Even more than that, we will.........find out what we can from Ted's genuine opinion.
    Brace yourselves!

              <h2><u>Liberia's Electoral System_</u></h2>
              <P>The Republic of Liberia adopts two divergent electoral systems; a plurality and an absolute majority system.</P>

              
          <p>The former is the chief rudiment in determining the winners of the sen atorial and representatives elections, while the latter serves the same purpose for the presidential elections. As is quite often the case ; as has been in every presidential elections  I have witnessed (2005,2011,2017), a second round is held between the two parties with the highest percentage of the total valid votes after all parties have proven to lack what it takes to amass 50% + 1 during the first round.</p>
          <p>The electorates often unintenionally waive their rights to scruitnize the candidates up for their jobs . Why? "Poverty" a friend of mine responded . We  make ourselves busy gifts-grabbing that we do not have time for questioning. Another smart head in my circle believes that illiteracy account for this, amongst other reasons. Burgess answer give me a memory trip back to one of my favorite poems, <i>Niyi's "The Leader and The Led", and pointed me directly to the last couplet of the poem</i></p>

    <P> A leader who knows how to follow </P>
    <p> Followers mindful of thier rights to lead</p>
    <p>Most electorates are ignorant of their right to lead -at least - themselves. In the same way as storms are terrible for humans, its is good for the plants in the spring, so although uninformed decision making is terrible for the country , its is good for the elected.</p>

                  <h2><u>Party Politics__</u></h2>
<p>A political party is a group of like-minded individual who workd together to influence policy by helping fill the government with those who share their ideology</p>
 <p>Our democracy allows for a multi-party system. This accounts for our long ballot papers almost longer than my Uncle's  Winners tickets, but no.</p>               
<p>The 2023 presidential election will be contested by TWENTY political parties. It is conspicuous to expert these longer ballots to mean a wide scope of choices , yes, it means so, theoretically, but not in actual sense. Barring any unprecedented circumstances, there are only three political parties with a realistic chance of winning. You've already gotten them correctly in your head. Let's have a glance at the major  political parties through the lens of <b>Ted</b>  </p>
</div>

<div class="middlecont cppl">
    <div class="profile">
      <h2><u>Collaborating Political Parties-</u></h2>
<p>Let's mind our words ; need not explain how the CPP began with four political parties , but is now left with two: Liberty Party and Alternative National Congress. Combined (LP = 9.62 & ANC = 7.21), they accounted for 16.83% of nthe 2017 presidential election. The CPP billboards , banners, and fliersare made beautiful by the charming looking legal luminaire , Charlyne M. Brumskine, and honorable by the business mogul , Alexander B. Cummings. THE FIXERS! Together they can do better, sorry -they commandexcellence and integrity. The CPP tickets appeals to any client in search of anew taste , a new experience. Given the balllot was a menu in a restaurant. <i> PS. client = citizen</i></p>
<p>Alexander B. Cummings executes whatever task he accepts diligently. I don't know him, would be glad if I did.Don't think I have seen him in flesh , but I knopw his story. His ascension at the Coca-Cola Company is enviable.But "Are you kidding me"?"You think leadership la to put water in bottle and shake it? Are you kidding me?" Laughs....But if a prolific soccer player can do this much as a president , a strong case can be made for a corporate expert. Dirt on his name? People say he is gay. Mr Cummings will bring gay lifestyle to Liberia. How has he responded to this ? "It's complete bullshit." "When people can't accuse you of stealing people's money, they craft these vicious lies."   </p>
<p>Charlyne is a true example of how our Facebook girls call themselves; beauty with brain. Graduated top of her class from the Louise Arthur Grimes School of Law, she is a sugar-tongue Liberian woman who has left a trail for any young Liberian lady desiring success in a law career.  Hailing from Grand Bassa County, Charlyne is not pleaded by the fact that her bassa speaking skills are terrible compared to her eloquence in the English language. But does it matter? but Our tongue  is what that connects us so well, but nothing can ever connect us better than our hearts. Charlyne does not  have a constituency. She was establishing one for herself in Buchanan, when she got an offer to become Mr. Cummings running mate. How audacious must she be to have left certain for uncertain. Winning the representative election in Grand Bassa , District 3 was a slam dunk, conjecture though. "Charlyne is inexperienced." She hjas not occupied any government position. Okay, prior occupation of a government position is a requirement to occupy a government position . Where's the logic? it is neither safe to say she's had her whole life outside politics, considering the steel to magnet relationship between Law and Politics. And oh! Lest I forget , her father was Charles W. Brumskine. I mean, CHARLES WALKER BRUMSKINE!. A Cummings -Brumskine blend is nothing short of trustworthiness to steer the affairs of Liberia. The challenge plaguing this duo is POPULARITY. I remember a man on Spoon TV saying that Cumming is his most preferred candidate, but he won't vote him because he will not win. An illogical case of striker saying I won't score for my team, because even if I score, we will not win. In a country with a very high  literacy rate, and an intellectual political culture the CPP would've stood a better chance, undoubtedly . Don't keep eyes off them!   </p>

    <h3><u>CPP's Challenges</u></h3>
    <p>As was stated earlier, the CPP faces the challenge of unpopularity. The CPP standard-bearer and VSB have not held an elected office. Thus , the lack of a solid constituency becomes a pressing issue. "Whoever controls the media controls the mind." But the CPP has downplayed Jim Morrison and I opinion. Still yet to see CPP TikTok Queen , Daughters of Cummings, Sons of Cummings, Scientists for Cummings. Not exactly these names but an auxiliary, or social media figure that pops up on our screens every time pushing us to lean the  the CPP side. So Ted thinks this is what is needeed to elect somebody; an auxiliary that pops us every time you open your social media? No, I don't think so, not at all.</p>
<p>In America, broadcasting channels such a CNN, MSNBC, and other media outlets controls the opinion of the citizens; they are the opinion leaders during campaign. The citizens pay much attention to the debates, and lean to the party that seeks to solve a certain problem, and tend to improve a particular sector in the society. As for Liberia, no. We don't care much about debates. We love the entertainment, the songs, the rally, the TikTok trends, the fun. We love to belong to a happy group. These are what that drive our alignment. The CPP is too serious, too diplomatic, for the Liberian political space. I guess.</p>

      <h2><u>Coalition for Democratic Change (CDC)-</u></h2>
      <p>Ahmandaa!! Arwayduu!! Marheebuyaay!! Ee Leebayria!! JorWeah JorWeah...Ardehbleh.....Your mun on ley road.....  14-1 to acquire the second round victory over the Unity Party in 2017. It's not just a bluff when the musician calls the only African Ballon D'or Winner 'Country Giant', it's a fact. But 2017 is gone, 2023 is here. Sing the next sentence, don't read it. "<i>We did it before, we will do it again.</i>" You sure? Time will tell. The Weah-Taylor ticket is definitely a perfect mixture of socialism and intellectualism. His Excellency, George Weah, scores full marks in terrain management. His ability to integrate into any social space is simply 'surmazing'. I've sat under the voice of Her Excellency, Jewel Howard Taylor, a few time, just as she has sat under mine while I read a poem. She may not have a space on your A-list of intellects, but she can't be below your B+. Jewel avails herself whenever call upon for an educational program. I may not be wrong, what I say, I say from personal experience. Noticed this during my time at the A.M Kyne Collegiate Resource  Center, and at Youth For Change's National Debate Championship. A couple of friends have told me about her turn-up for their academic needs as well. And oh, the <b>Jewel Starfish Foundation.</b></p>
<p>George Weah will support academism, but please don't have high hopes for his presence at your academic events, expect a proxy, at most. But bet the world to nothing, he will play street soccer with you under the rain in Rally Town Market. He will avail himself to the Basketball Coach for a county meet tournament from Group Stage up to the Final, and even though he can purchase the entire Monroe Chicken, he will buy fifty dollars roasted cassava, and ask for change. This is Manneh for you. His humility, his refusal to stay on his high horse, his unwillingness to raise his shoulders. This is why he is the most  beloved Liberian ever born by a woman. Dirt on his name? <b>"George Weah na know book."</b> Sing <i>"You know book, youna know book, we will vote for you" Thing is, Liberians, we no fit explain taya, we just dey sing. We don't want to give reasons why we like you, we will sing a song about our love for you. <i>"You kill my ma, you kill my pa, I will vote for you"</i> This was 1997. That's is how it's been, that's the way it's gonna be. Sadly, maybe. But what CDC is today, owes much to a long list of other names, not just Gbehkugneh and Aunty Jewel. It is a Mass Party. Everyone-from the chairman to the common die-hard loyalist-is willing to lay his life on the line for the Standard-bearer. The party at the headquarter doesn't end. The togetherness makes you want to be there. This is, undoubtedly, something other parties should emulate.</p>

    <h2><u>CDC's Challenges</u></h2>
    <p>When you are too rich that you become wasteful, your positive (riches) is your negative (slanderous). CDC faces a similar problem. Their positive is their negative. The popularity of CDC can make any party jealous, but it is this popularity, consisting of extremists that will do the absurd things <b>(the casket something + many more)</b> that creates strong a dislike for CDC in the heart of individuals that are on the fence. George Weah is a charismatic leader, already naturally beloved. A little dress up is diplomatic garment will be a significant addiction to his personage. If he can choose to act like a President during his discussions <b>(like the one with Firestone Board Members),</b> his state of the Nation Address, and campaign speeches, he will definitely attract love, from citizens who are sapiophiles. Until then, oppositions will continue to have a reason to say, <i>"loka ley one we call President."</i></p>

    <h2><u>Unity Party UP-</u></h2>
    <p>Here's an irony for your reading pleasure, the disunity among the Unity Party and other parties within the CPP led to their disabandment. The former ruiling party. The nation's leading opposition, arguably. Let's delve into the Unity Party. As its loco pilot, Hon. Joseph Nyumah Boakai drives the rain in the direction of the Executive Mansion. But will the Rescue Mission come to an end before it even start? Time will Tell. The political Guru, as described by Irvin, Joseph Nyumah Boakai has a neat governmental record void of any corruption scandal. Not many people will choose integrity over wealth. Joseph did. This is why his retinues believe in him. If the mansion's key should be held by the cleanest hand, a good case can be proffer for Uncle Joe. The growth in the agricultural sector during his spell as the Minister under Ex-President Samuel K. Doe was visible, thus commendable. With over 45 years of government experience under his belt,there can be no questioning to his ability to excel at the Presidency. Uncle Joe will definitely not be an on the job learner. He brings his wealth of experience <b>(you can't teach old dogs new tricks),</b> and stakes his claim to his pack.</p>
   <p>There is a new face behind the former Vice President in his second bid to become D President. Hon. Jeremiah Koung has been subbed on to replace Hon. Emmanuel Nuquay who was Mr. Boakai vice running mate in 2017. The former head of the senate favors the idea of running with legislators, turns out. Senator Jeremiah Koung is a man with great calm. An attribute mutually shared by his Standard Bearer. Hon. Koung is a man of few words. He let's his actions so the talking. This has earned him much respect and makes him a reputable character among his coleagues, and the people of Nimba. The role of Sen. Prince Y. Johnson in securing the VSB slot for Hon. Koung can not be overstated as was emphasized in the leaked audio. The JNB-JKK ticket is an experienced team with solid constituencies. More over, there's a plus of Nyonblee Lawrence Karngar <b>Rescue Mother,</b> Liberia's most popular female legislator, who adds weight to the train by her undisputable influence in the Bassaland. If we will have a transition in the 2024, It's most likely to be the UP, but don't count your chicks before they're hatched. </p>
</div>
<div class="middlecont">
  <div class="profile">
    <h2><u>UP's Challenges</u></h2>
    <p>The level of internal distrust within the Unity Party is terrifying. Their internal body politics seems like a game of chess. Everyone's a pawn, everyone's a bishop, and the few kings have their distinguished knights. Jeremiah Koung interview with OK FM in 2020 comparing JNB with father wearing pampers, the leaked audio of PYJ, the audio that haven't leaked yet. Why did Sen. Nyonblee Karngar Lawrence part ways with her party (LP) even after she wasn't chosen by Hon. Boakia? A lot of things indicate that everyone has something under his sleeves. <b>And now we can't  be sure whether Mr. Boakai is being fooled, or playing fool to fool the fools who think they are fooling him.</b></p>
  <p>Born on 30 November 1944, Joseph N. Boakai is currently 78 years old, same age as Joe Biden, US Pfresident, and the age of Madam. Ellen J. Sirleaf when she left power. <b>The Demography doesn't favor Mr. Boakai.</b> I don't see why non-supporters of JNB will consider Mr. Boakai too old to become president when the constitution does not have a ban on 78 years old becoming president. However, I don't see how their consideration of the age factor is illogical given the fact that people of age 65 and above constitute only 3% of liberia population. Worse more 78 and above should probably be around 1% or less. This was a matter that gained the interest of Joshua Kulah, a genius lawyer, who voiced up his candid opinion via a face book write-up. The chances of youthful majority entrusting the nation into the hands of a member of the class of 3% sit lower than a stripper's skirt. But ours is a nation of endless possibilities, anyway.</p>

      <h2><u>Political Culture</u></h2>
      <h4><i>(The Head and The Heart)</i></h4>
      <p>There are three types of political culture (Participant, Subject, & Parochial) universally. The three are well existent in Liberia; some Liberians are political junkies, some are only intrigued by the big political news, other simply don't give a damn. However, in the scope of my assessment on the 2023 electoral process, I'd like to categorize my circle of Liberians as the Head of The Heart. The Head is made up of those who have valid political opinions-and could have enormous influence in these elections only if they choose to get involved-but are not involved. This includes, but is not limited to, the likes of Beyan Kpangbala, Paula Lela Jeremiah, Charles Bentell, Malcolm Smith, Cephas Kpogbah, Jamal Ghoson, Daniel Garteh, Kelvin Zokpo. All  certified intellects who have won my admiration by making a lot of sense every time I listen to them. While they are publicly non-aligned, they hold distinguish secret alignments, if this is needed to be said. Funnily however, a few names on the list do not know who to vote for yet, but know fully well who they will vote not for. </p>
    <p>The Heart, on the other hand , consists of gullible individuals who are very much invlove. You know there can be no pointing fingers here. Of a prominent mention, there is another group that I feel obliged to applaud. The group consisting of indidviduals with valid political opinions who are also well involved in these elections. This is the list where you find the names of Romeo Sondah, Cedric Jones, Randolph D. Chengbe, Nicholas Brosius, Darcess Dossen, Edmond Tuazama, Bob Queminee, Saah Kandu, Irvin Nyumah, Mamadee Sackor, Jeremiah Nemour, C. Ernest Godfrey, etc.... It peaks my interest then; why would these geniuses  <b>(The Head)</b> choose to have back-roll seat when even people with less than half their knowledge and influential power are at the front of these elections? It is unsubstantial to align the tight-lips of The Heads in these electoral processes to disinterestedness, and a tunnel vision conclusion, without considering a myriad of the factors that are actually responsible. </p>
 <p>Inasmuch as one would like to get involved, the Liberian political space is besotted by thuggery,political killings,and unbridled violence. As shared in the view of O.S Afolabi, all these sponsor the constant failure of Liberian political and electoral process in engineering a wider participation in the political process and full and open participation in electoral activities. Better save my opinion, and save my life, than share my opinion and lose my life. Most people resolve. When we rise above the confines of barbarism, and realize that our political disputes are better resolved by dialogues, and not violence. When we can ensure a safe and healthier political space, then  and then only, we can be assured of a wider participation in our political process. The Wheels will then get in the hands of the right wheelers. </p>

    <div class="profile">
      <h2><u>Expectation & Reality-</u></h2>
      <p>There is not much in the campaign speeches for ears that ache to hear the the manifestos of the political candidates. For citizens who are concerned about what problems these candidates want to solve, what sectors they want to improve, what will be done in the first 100 days, their first 3 years, their short term plans, their long term plans, disappointment is what that awaits you most times. This is because every speech at a campaign rally is a <b>new 'diss-track',</b> and the jabs the candidates throw at each other is likened unto our musician beef. No need to fill this paper with their words tongue-lashing each other. It's all over the media. However, it will be unfair to cast this blanket over every candidates. There are some who are well focused on their messages, and are resisting their drag into the royal rumble of jabs-throwing  being dominated by UP and CDC. The CPP's candidates have been decent in their messages and apporach yet. Maybe they will join the royal rumble, maybe not. Cllr. Tiawon Gongle, the broom man,has been clean with his messages as well. As well as the political prodigy Clarence Moniba, who I consider to have an increasing chance as the years go by given the fact age favors him, and his vision is attractive. In short, the citizens are consumers who have informed the producers that they are not interested in buying their manifestos. The most sought after commodity is entertainment. Thus, those parties that exhibit what ought to be are not favorable in this market.</p>

    <h2><u>The Right to Extrapolate</u></h2>
    <h4><b>This election will be a one-round victory for.....</b></h4>
    <p>I can't help but wonder whether people are truly incognizant, or simply delusional. A one-round victory? 20 parties? Are you kidding me? It is easier for Lonestar to win the 2024 AFCON than to imagine any party securing a one-round victory. In 2017, there were 2,183,629 registered voters. However the total turnouts were 1,641,922 accounting for 75.19% of the total 100%. The highest a party could acquire was CDC = 596, 037(38.37%) of the total valid votes. The only other party to acquire double figure in terms of % was UP = 446,716 (28.76%). There is a little increase in the number of registerd voters this time with 2,471,183 active registrants. In a state of endless possibilities, we are constrained to limit our predictions to the most likely probability. Let's approximate 1,929,476 voters go to the polls, and invalid votes chop out 75,000 votes, leaving a total of 1,854,476 valid votes. With this stat, a party would need to acquire 927,239 votes to achieve a one-round victory. But why is this not possible? Have your forgotten? CDC has a 1 million citizens rally . Catch a break, bruh. Although the possibility  of a one-round victory is off the cards, one shouldn't have problems predicting the two parties that will make it to the second round. Moreover , extrapolating the ultimate winner after all is too easy. However, this is the partwhere I plead the fifth. I waive my rights to extrapolate gladly.</p>
